Jobs that need doing
--------------------

* Create a stellar population for a young cluster in the galactic centre
    * Use Arches as the archetype
* Assign random motions to the catalogue of star, using the total mass of the
  cluster to determine the energies of each star
* Put the cluster on a course around the black hole
    * Work out the trajectory for a distance of 25 pc from GC
* Make a population of fore and background stars based on the population
  density of the stars in the Milky way
    * Find out what the Milky way stellar density profile looks like.
    * Generate a poulation model based on a 5 Gyr sample
        * Ask Eline about this
* Assign random proper motions to the fore and background stars. Add a sideways
  component to the stars based on their distance from the galactic centre

* Observe the field for several epochs. Evolve the star positions between each
  each observation
    * Use median seeing conditions with SCAO
    * Determine how large the cluster will be at a distance of 8.5kpc
    * Add in 3 mags of K-band extinction

* Extract the stars using normal PSF photometry
    * Learn to use photutils properly

* Try to match the stars from the previous epochs
    * Learn how to match stars

* Determine the proper motions of the stars
* Determine probability of cluster membership
    * Use the average proper motion of the cluster to determine which stars
      are members

* FIt the stars to a K-band luminosity function
