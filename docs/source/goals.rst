The galactic centre is a very different environment to the solar neighbourhood
Tidal forces, high radiation fields
Star shouldn't be able to form here, but they do. See the Arches cluster and the
quintet cluster
These conditions are said to be similar to those dound in the early universe
Hence we can use the GC as a proxy for star formation in th early universe
IMF universality.
We want to know whether or not the IMF of the Arches cluster is indeed the
same as the IMF in local clouds.
However the clusters in the galactic centre suffer for confusion, given that
there are so many field stars along the line of sight
The best way to disentagle the cluster members from the general fore- and
background stars is to use astrometry.
If we wait a while, the bound member of the cluster should move in the same
as the clusters average motion. All other stars will move in random direction
This will allow us to do a cencus of the young stellar population and hence
determine whether or not the young cluster IMF at the GC is the same or
different to the local star forming environments
The ELT and MICADO will provide the sensitivity and resolution to pick out more
stars than ever before, and the astrometry will allow us to determine
memberships,
